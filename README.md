# Nice Maps links
*Nice links, but have you been to Maps yourself?*

My friend from Japan gave me a list of a hundred google maps links for places to visit there. I do not have the patience to read through each one of them, so we'll use an LLM to read them for me and brief me.

Uses a small LLM with local inference + curl to retrieve data.
